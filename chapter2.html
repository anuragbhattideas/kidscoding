    <h1>How Visiting Websites Works</h1>
    <p>Imagine you're at home and want to visit a new park in your town. You ask your parents to take you there. Visiting a website is similar:</p>
    <h2>1. Typing the Website Address (URL)</h2>
    <p>Just like you tell your parents the name of the park, you type the website's address (like <code>www.example.com</code>) into your computer's browser.</p>
    <h2>2. Your Computer Sends a Request</h2>
    <p>This is like your parents driving you to the park. Your computer sends a message over the internet asking to visit the website.</p>
    <h2>3. The Website Responds</h2>
    <p>When you arrive at the park, you see all the playground equipment and paths. Similarly, the website sends back information—like text, pictures, and videos—that your browser shows on your screen.</p>
    <p>This back-and-forth happens very quickly, so when you press "Enter," the website appears almost instantly.</p>
    <h2>Understanding Cookies</h2>
    <p>When you visit some websites, they use small files called "cookies" to remember things about you. It's like when you visit your doctor:</p>
    <div class="example">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>First Visit:</strong> The doctor writes down your information and health history.</li>
            <li><strong>Next Visits:</strong> The doctor remembers you and knows your history, so you don't have to repeat everything.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Similarly, cookies help websites remember your preferences, like your username or language choice, so you have a smoother experience next time you visit.</p>
    <h2>Staying Safe Online</h2>
    <p>Just as you look both ways before crossing the street, it's important to be careful online:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Be Cautious with Personal Information:</strong> Don't share your name, address, or school with strangers online.</li>
        <li><strong>Talk to Trusted Adults:</strong> If something online makes you uncomfortable, tell a parent or teacher.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Privacy Settings:</strong> Many websites have settings to help keep your information private. Make sure they're turned on.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By understanding how visiting websites works and following safety tips, you can enjoy exploring the internet while staying safe.</p>
